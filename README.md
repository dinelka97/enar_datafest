# ENAR Datafest - Team XXX

In lieu of ENAR 2025, a datafest has been organized to work with a curated dataset 
from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to answer important questions related to blood pressure control.

We were required to consider a problem, issue, or a policy relevant to the following problem statement.

## Problem Statement 

Controlling blood pressure (BP) reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease. However, the prevalence of BP control 
(i.e., systolic BP < 140 and diastolic BP < 90) among US adults with hypertension has decreased since 2013. 
We invite teams to analyze publicly available data from US adults to help identify potential causes or correlates of 
worsening BP control among US adults with hypertension over the past decade, as this may allow for development of 
effective interventions to help control BP and prevent cardiovascular disease. 

## Data Description 

* The NHANES dataset contains data from 59,799 noninstitutionalized US adults collected between 1999 and 2020.
* The data can be downloaded from GitHub or accessed via the cardioStatsUSA R package. 
* For both the file and information about the R package, see https://github.com/jhs-hwg/cardioStatsUSA.
* For a detailed description of all variables in the data, see https://jhs-hwg.github.io/cardioStatsUSA/reference/nhanes_data.html.
* Interactive exploration: A shiny application has been created to help explore hypertension statistics for US adults using these data. 
The application is available here: https://bcjaeger.shinyapps.io/nhanesShinyBP/
* For more details on the data and the shiny application, see the supporting paper\
